# Sales-Analysis-Project-2
A simplified dashboard on Coffee sales analysis
The goal is to transform the data into dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends and
opportunities for the business

## Requirements
a.) <b> Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis
b.) Explore the data with Excel PivotTables
c.) Build a dynamic dashboard to visualise trends and patterns

# Objectives
## 1. Prepare the data for analysis
- Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the data. How many transactions were recorded, over what period of time. What products
  and product categories were sold?
- Add a new column to calculate Revenue (price * quantity)
- Add new columnss to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date 
  (Bonus: display them as text (i.e "Jan", "Feb", "Sun", "Mon") instead of numerical values)
- Add new column to extract Hour from the transaction time

## 2. Explore data with Pivot Tables
- Insert a PivotTable on new tab to show revenue by month
- Add two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product category, sorted, descending by transactions
- Add PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by by product type, sorted descending and filtered
  to the Top 15 (by transactions)

## 3. Build a Dynamic Dashboard
- Add Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts and
  transactions by product category as a barchart
- Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout and include space for PivotTable showing Top 15 product types
- Add a slicer for store location and connect it to all pivot tables on the sheet
